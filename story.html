      <p>
        Glaze diary is a small studio assistant for people who like to remember
        what went into the bucket, not just what came out of the kiln. It keeps
        recipes, test tiles, and accidents in one place, so you can trace every
        surface on your favorite bowl.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each card pairs an image with its formula, maker, and notes. Over time,
        the archive becomes a shared memory of experiments, firings, and the
        unexpected things that happen between clay and fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use glaze diary to log tests, share recipes, or revisit the surfaces you
        love when you are away from the studio.
